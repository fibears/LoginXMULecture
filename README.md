# Secure a seat From XMU Lecture Website.

[Official Website](http://event.wisesoe.com/)

As you known, we must attend 10 Lectures every semester	 in Econ, XMU. Firstly, we must reserve the lecture in official website. At begin of the semester, everyone is crazy to grab the ticket, and all of the lectures will be snatched by others in a minute.

As a lazy man, I don't like to wait for reserving the lecture in time. So, I try to write a script to automate the reservation process.

Finally, I succeed in developing the `web robot`.

Didn't reserve successfully for a lecture? No worry, my robot will help you secure your seat in advance, fast, free and friendly.

## How to run this robot?

1. Install Python2.7
2. Install lxml package
3. Open auto.sh(OSX or Linux) or auto.bat(Windows) by text editor. And change the "Username" and "Passwd" to your real account information.
4. Finally, run auto.sh or auto.bat file.
